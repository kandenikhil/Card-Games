President --------------------------------------------
How to play: Start with dealing all the cards. three is the lowest, while two is the highest. Dealer starts first. The goal of the game is to get rid of all of your cards. You start by either placing either singles, doubles, triples, or quads of any number. the next person has to place the same amount of cards, but a higher number. so if person A put double threes, person B can only put double of any number higher than a three. If a two is put down, it is considered the highest number, so it will reset the board and the player can put any number of their choosing. the game continues until all but one person has put down all their cards. for the next round, the first person that got rid of all of their cards will trade two of their lowest cards to the person who was last, and the last person will trade their two best to the first person. then the second person who won will trade one card to the second lowest, and visa versa. if there is an uneven amount of players, one may be "middleman," who will not gain or lose cards. Max of two cards traded for fairness.
