# Card-Games

A whole heap of card games that you can play with other people (no solo's)

List:

Gin

How to play:

President 

How to play: Start with dealing all the cards. three is the lowest, while two is the highest. Dealer starts first. The goal of the game is to get rid of all of your cards. You start by either placing either singles, doubles, triples, or quads of any number. the next person has to place the same amount of cards, but a higher number. so if person A put double threes, person B can only put double of any number higher than a three. If a two is put down, it is considered the highest number, so it will reset the board and the player can put any number of their choosing. the game continues until all but one person has put down all their cards. for the next round, the first person that got rid of all of their cards will trade two of their lowest cards to the person who was last, and the last person will trade their two best to the first person. then the second person who won will trade one card to the second lowest, and visa versa. if there is an uneven amount of players, one may be "middleman," who will not gain or lose cards. Max of two cards traded for fairness.

James Bond

How to play: You're given a certain number of stacks of 4 cards (depending on the number of players). You're trying and get four of a kind in all stacks of cards you have. You do this by trading out the cards you have in each stack with the cards in the middle. You are only allowed to look at one stack at a time. As soon as you get all stacks done, you slap all of them and "shoot" whoever you want to go out.

Spit

How to play: You start off with 5 stacks of cards in your hand (if you're playing with more than two people, adjust according to number of people). One with 5, one with 4, one with 3 etc. All facing down. You then turn over the top card in each stack. You're only allowed to get rid of top cards. You're trying to get rid of all the cards in your hand and slap the smallest stack in the middle. To get rid of a card, you place it in a stack, but you can only place it if your card is right before or right after the card (i.e. You can only place a Jack if a Queen or 10 is facing up)

Kill the Landlord

How to play: Presidents only players team up to beat the "landlord" (which is chosen randomly). Also at the beginning of the game, three extra cards are drawn randomly and the landlord can choose to take it or not take it. Players can place down anything as long as its value is higher than the value before it. Players can also do doubles, triples, triples and one card, straight, or bombs (full house or two jokers). If no one can beat your play or passes on it, then it clears the board and you get start the next play however you like. The landlord's job is to not lose, while the other players are in charge of not letting the landlord win.

BS

How to play: The goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards. To start you deal out every card to all players in the game. The first person to go is whoever has the ace of spades. Then the next player MUST play a two facing down. Then next player plays facing down a three and so forth. If you don't have a card you need to play, you can lie about it, but other players can call your bluff or "BS" and if they're correct, then you must take the pile in the middle and the game continues where it left off

ERS

How to play: The object of the game is to end up with all the cards in the deck. The dealer deals out all the cards to all players. You MUST keep your cards faced down and not look at them. One person goes first and flips his/her card over and lays it in the middle for everyone to see. The next person does the same and this keeps going until there's either two cards of the same number/face or two of the same number/face cards sandwiching another card. As soon as you see this, you must slap the pile before anyone else. If you do, you get to keep the pile. If you end up running out of cards to give, you're out, but you can slap back in (depends who you're playing with). This whole process will go on until someone ends up with all the cards

Texas Hold em' Poker

How to play: Look it up, too damn complicated to write.

Beat the Dealer

How to play: basically blackjack but with cheating allowed as long as the Dealer never catches you. Cheating includes trading with someone, discarding cards, etc. Cannot be done programmatically. 

Black Jack

How to play: the dealer deals out two cards to each player. The player must have a card total of 21 or close to 21 (i.e. 19, 20, etc. Basically anything not over 21). Number cards equaling their respective number and all face cards equal 10. Ace can equal either 11 or 1. If you get two cards that's short 21, you may ask the dealer to "hit you" and give you another card to try and get 21. You may tell the dealer to pass you if you think you have enough. If you got over 21, you busted and are out. You check cards once everyone has either busted or passed. Then there's a bunch of rules about the dealer I don't exactly get so Leo you're on your own with that

Shanghai

How to play: dealer deals each person 11 cards. It is almost like presidents except you must play the card right after it (i.e. If there's an 8 you must play a 9). If you don't have it, you can merely pass with no consequences. If no one has the next card, the person who played the unplayable card has to draw another card. You can play that card you drew or put it in your hand and choose a different card to play. If no one has the next card after that, you have to draw another card. And this goes on until someone has the corresponding card. You can play doubles triples or quads and if no one can play it, you still only have to draw one card. Everyone keeps going until one person runs out of cards.

Hearts

President Teams

How to play:  presidents but with teams. If one of you gets out, then both of you get out. Also you can trade cards with your teammate at any given time to ensure winning.

Spoons

How to play: the point of the game is to get 4 of a kind and/or not be the last person to try and grab a spoon. Everyone is dealed four cards. Spoons are laid in the middle. Number of spoons is basically one less than the number of players (i.e. 6 players equals 5 spoons). The dealer starts by grabbing one card from the stack of cards that never got dealed. He/she can choose to keep this card or pass (or discard it) to the player next to him/her. If they choose to keep it, they must give away another card in return for all players must have only 4 cards in each hand. Everyone keeps passing and trading until one person gets four of a kind. As soon as this happens, that person can now grab a spoon. As soon as you notice a spoon is taken, you can go and grab one of the spoons. The person without a spoon is out. This goes on until one player is victorious.

Mafia

How to play: role playing with cards. One person is mafia (must get drawn the king) and can kill people. Goal is to not be found out. One person is nurse (must get drawn the queen) and can "heal" anyone who possibly got killed by the mafia. That person isn't able to know who got killed. Then there is a detective (must get drawn the ace) who can make his accusations on who the mafia is. Townspeople (anyone without a face card) can choose to vote this person as mafia or not. Dealer is also the narrator. (Leo if you're gonna add this game, please add a feature where the dealer can type out the stories to make it interesting). The game keeps going until the mafia is found out or everyone died.

Uno

How to play: you should know how to play. However, there are special rules that can be added. You can 'stack' cards; so in other words, you can put multiple cards if they are all the same number/power. For +2 and +4s, if the person has a +2/+4 of their own, they can put it down and it passes onto the next person, where that person can add on, and ect ect until no one can stack anymore and they take the full amount.
